I've been deploying and managing infrastructure of the for some of the worlds largest Telecom, entertainment, aviation and IT organization for more then 15 years. I've started my IT journey  as a hardware engineer (mostly worked on Sun Microsystem servers).

And from past 12+ years I'm mostly into virtualization and cloud world. During these years, I've seen state of the arts many times, from Data centers to co-location facility and now to the cloud.

I've witnessed infrastructure paradigms shift from monolithic to distributed systems, to virtual machines and containers. One thing that, I noticed as the systems become more and more virtualized the possibilities have opened up along with some challenges like, how to keep track of these changes.

In cloud one thing is constant, that is change. Cloud is elastic, how you are going to deal with the infrastructure. How can you recreate your environment. How can you replicate your environment to another cloud region.

This changes gives birth of DevOps tools like Configuration Management. 

In DevOps world configuration management is the King. Using the config management tools, we can keep our environment up-to-date automatically. And believe it is very easy to implement.

However, with todays dynamic environment, the infrastructure itself must be automated. Gone are the days, where we spend most of our time to update the servers and OS, now we are just replacing them newest, latest and greatest version in couple of seconds.

Serverless( Function and Lambda), makes the whole concept of the servers obsolete. So, what are tools available to deal with this situation????

**The answer is Infrastructure as a code (IAC)**

In this talk, I'm going to discuss about IAC using software development lifecycle. We are going to discuss about Terraform. Before going to start, I would like to inform you that this is not a any tutorial, I'm just going to share my experience and the way I learn it.



Why to manage your infrastructure as a code?

- Introduction to Terraform?
- How to Install it?
- Once we build the concept,we will dive deeper to understand the Terraform configuration
- We will learn Terraform configuration Language HCL
- We will further go deeper in code reuse and encapsulation technique with Terraform modules
- Collaboration with Terraform using Terraform Cloud
- Continuous Deployment with Terraform
- How to use Terraform, by extending the Terraform
- Managing Helm and Kubernetes with Terraform
